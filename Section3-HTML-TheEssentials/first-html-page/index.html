    <h2>Walter White to Skyler White</h2>
    <p>A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without
        me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM
        the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!</p>

    <h2>Walter White to Jesse Pinkman</h2>
    <p>Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of
        us. And now, he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does
        that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he playing. Does he think
        you're that na√Øve? He can't truly think that you'd forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the
        horror that goes along with all of that.</p>
